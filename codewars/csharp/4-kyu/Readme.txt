[For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!

In this kata you need to check the provided array (x) for good ideas 
'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good ideas, return 
'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a series!'. If there 
are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.]

P - Review the provided array for good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'.
If the array contains one or two good ideas, return 'Publish!'. If the array contains
more than two good ideas, return 'I smell a series'. If there are no good ideas, 
return 'Fail!' Since arrays have limited functionality, it could be better to convert
the array to a list and run through the code.

E - 
{ } [no ideas at all]
{ "good", "bad", "good", "bad", "bad", "good" }
{ "good", "bad" }
{ "good", "good", "good", "bad" }
{ "bad", "bad", "bad", "bad" }
{ "good", "bad" }

D - Array 
    

A - 

C -
